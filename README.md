# 100 Days of Code: Days 1 - 10
I've been learning Python through the [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) course on Udemy. This course by [Dr. Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/user/4b4368a3-b5c8-4529-aa65-2056ec31f37e/) contains a daily collection of video lessons that include smaller coding challenges, where concepts are introduced. At the end of each day, you are challenged with a more difficult Final Project where you bring together all you learned in previous the lessons. I am documenting here the code I've written for each of these daily Final Projects.

## Day 1 - Working with Variables in Python

### Band Name Generator Project

Please check out my Band Name Generator project, using what I learned on Day 1. </br>
[Band Name Generator](https://replit.com/@JackBarbaria/Day1BandNameGenerator?v=1)

```python
print("Welcome to Jazzy Jack's Band Name Generator!!\nHave fun and don't get too excited!!")
user_city = input("What city or town did you grow up in? ")
pet_name = input("What is the name of a pet that you like? ")
print("Here is the name of your band: \n" + user_city + " " + pet_name)
```
Day 1 was all about learning how to use the print, len, and input functions. I also learned how to manipulate strings, and how to create variables in Python. 

## Day 2 - Data Types and Manipulating Strings

### Tip Calculator Project

Check out the Tip Calculator project I created using the concepts I learned during Day 2. I learned about different data types and how to convert between them. I also learned how to manipulate strings and numbers. 

[Tip Calculator](https://replit.com/@JackBarbaria/Day-2-Tip-Calculator?v=1)

```python
print("Welcome to Jazzy Jack's tip calculator.\nFor those of us who are math challenged, this is the tool for you!")
total_bill = input("What is the total bill? $")
tip_percentage = input("What percentage tip would you like to give? 12, 15, 20, etc? ")
no_people = input("How many people to split the bill? ")
tipsy = "1." + tip_percentage
tipsy = float(tipsy)
split = (float(total_bill) * tipsy)/float(no_people)
print(f"Each person should pay: ${split:.2f}")
```


## Day 3 - Control Flow and Logical Operators
### Choose Your Own Adventure
Check out my choose your own adventure game written using what I learned during Day 3!

[Treasure Island - Choose Your Own Adventure](https://replit.com/@JackBarbaria/Day-3-treasure-island?v=1)

## Day 5 - Python Loops, Range, and Code Blocks
### Password Generator
The Day 5 final challenge stretched me to the limit. It was fun to watch the instructor's solution after I had written my version and see how Dr. Yu solved this challenge in about half the lines of code that I had written. I'm still excited that I got there at the end. 

[Password Generator](https://replit.com/@JackBarbaria/Day-5-password-generator?v=1)

```python
#Password Generator Project
import random
letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K', 'L', 'M', 'N', 'O', 'P', 'Q', 'R', 'S', 'T', 'U', 'V', 'W', 'X', 'Y', 'Z']
numbers = ['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9']
symbols = ['!', '#', '$', '%', '&', '(', ')', '*', '+']

print("Welcome to the PyPassword Generator!\n")
nr_letters= int(input("How many letters would you like in your password?\n")) 
nr_symbols = int(input(f"How many symbols would you like?\n"))
nr_numbers = int(input(f"How many numbers would you like?\n"))

# generating random letters
let_result = ''
for letter in range(0, (nr_letters)):
  L = random.randint(0, 41)
  let_result += letters[L]

# generating random number
num_result = ''
for number in range(0, (nr_numbers)):
  X = random.randint(0, 9)
  num_result += numbers[X]

# generating random symbols
sym_result = ''
for number in range(0, (nr_symbols)):
  S = random.randint(0, 8)
  sym_result += symbols[S]

# combining the results into one string
combined = let_result + num_result + sym_result

num_of_char = len(combined)

# converting the string to a list
rando_list = []
for app in range(0, (num_of_char)):
  rando_list.append(combined[app])

# randomizing the order of the list
random.shuffle(rando_list)

# converting the shuffled list back to a string
rando_password = ''
for app2 in range(0, (num_of_char)):
  rando_password += rando_list[app2]

print(f"\nYour password is {rando_password}")
```


## Day 6 - Python Functions
### Reeborg's Maze 
The Day 6 lesson focused on how to define your own functions. It also introduced the **while** loop and highlighted the differences between **while** and **for** loops. Today's challenges intruduced me to [Reeborg's World](https://reeborg.ca/index_en.html). At Reeborg's World you use Python to automate the actions of a robot in order to complete a task. In the final challenge of the day, Reeborg is placed in a randomly generated maze, facing in a random direction, and the goal is to guide Reeborg out of the maze. This was a difficult challenge for me, as there were certain conditions that would occur that would cause Reeborg to walk in a circle in an infinite loop. After I slept on on it, I realized I could track the number of turns Reeborg makes and force him to do something different, avoiding the loop.

## Day 7 - Hangman

Day 7 was entirely devoted to making a **hangman** game. Check out my version of the game here: [Hangman](https://replit.com/@JackBarbaria/Day-7-Hangman-Project?v=1).

<br />
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/wpHw6n1.png" height="40%" width="40%" alt="Hangman"/>
<br />

Today's lesson encouraged me to create a flowchart to break down the game of **hangman** into its indivdual components. This flowchart would become the blueprint for designing the game. Then with the help of the Day 7 challenges, writing the game was broken down into 5 steps: 
1. Picking a word and checking the user's answer.
2. Display blanks for each letter of the word and replacing the blanks with guesses.
3. Checking if the player has won.
4. Keeping track of the player's lives.
5. Improving the user's experience.

I added a couple features that were not in the original guide. I wanted to add some sort of input validation, as I noticed the game would break if I accidently typed two letters for my guess. So, I created a list that included all the capital and lower case letters of the alphabet and the game now checks to see if the input matches this list. If the player's accidently types in "aa" it will not match the validation list and the player will be asked to try again. I also had the program, track previous guesses so if the player picked the same letter twice, they would be asked to chose another letter.

The provided word list is challenging as it only provides the player with a single word to guess. I find it's easier to play **hangman** if you can pick a category (like Movies, or Phrases) and then have a puzzle with multiple words. While I was able to expirement with a list of movie titles, I was having trouble altering the program to allowing the player to choose from multiple puzzle categories. I'll come back this later, after I have learned more Python.

## Day 8 - Function Parameters
### Caesar Cypher Project

Today, I learned how to add parameters and how to pass arguments into functions. This helped me complete the Day 8 challenge to create a program that allows the user to encode and decode messages using a Caesar, or shift cypher.

[Caesar Cypher Program](https://replit.com/@JackBarbaria/Day-8-Caesar-Cypher?v=1)

```python
alphabet = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']

def caesar(code_text, shift_amount, cypher_direction):
  scrambled_text = ""
  if cypher_direction == "decode":
    shift_amount *= -1
  for letter in code_text:
    if letter not in alphabet:
      new_letter = letter
    else:
      original_index = alphabet.index(letter)
      new_index = original_index + shift_amount
      if new_index < 0:
        new_index += 26
      elif new_index > 25:
        new_index -= 26 
      new_letter = alphabet[new_index]
    scrambled_text += new_letter
  print(f"The {cypher_direction}d text is {scrambled_text}")

import art
print(art.logo) 

Start = True
while Start:
  direction = input("Type 'encode' to encrypt, type 'decode' to decrypt:\n")
  text = input("Type your message:\n").lower()
  shift = (int(input("Type the shift number:\n"))) % 26

  caesar(code_text=text, shift_amount=shift, cypher_direction=direction)
  go_again = input('Type "yes" if you want to go again. Otherwise type "no".\n')
  if go_again == "no":
    Start = False

print("Goodbye")
```

## Day 9 - Dictionaries and Nesting
### Secret Auction Project

Day 9 was focused on Dictionaries and how to nest dictionaries within lists and lists within dictionaries, and even dictionaries within dictionaries. It was wild!! I followed along and built a Secret or Blind Auction program. It always fascinates me to see the differences in the code in my version of program versus the solution presented by the instructor. 

Check out my [Secret Auction Program](https://replit.com/@JackBarbaria/Day-9-Blind-Auction?v=1)

```python
from replit import clear
import art

bid_list = []
def add_bid_info(new_name, new_amount):
  new_bidder = {}
  new_bidder["name"] = new_name
  new_bidder["amount"] = new_amount
  bid_list.append(new_bidder)

more = True
while more == True:
  print(art.logo)
  print("Welcome to the secret auction program.")
  bid_name = input("What is your name?: ")
  bid_amount = int(input("What's your bid?: $"))

  add_bid_info(new_name=bid_name, new_amount=bid_amount)
  
  more_bidders = input("\nAre there any other bidders? Type 'yes' or 'no'.\n")
  if more_bidders == "no":
    more = False
  else:
    clear()

highbidder = ""
highbid = 0
for bid in bid_list:
  dolla = bid["amount"]
  namo = bid["name"]
  if dolla > highbid:
    highbid = dolla
    highbidder = namo

clear()
print(art.celebration)
print(f"The winner is {highbidder} with a bid of ${highbid}")
```
