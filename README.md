# Day 1 - Working with Variables in Python

## Band Name Generator Project

Please check out my Band Name Generator project, using what I learned on Day 1. </br>
[Band Name Generator](https://replit.com/@JackBarbaria/Day1BandNameGenerator?v=1)

```python
print("Welcome to Jazzy Jack's Band Name Generator!!\nHave fun and don't get too excited!!")
user_city = input("What city or town did you grow up in? ")
pet_name = input("What is the name of a pet that you like? ")
print("Here is the name of your band: \n" + user_city + " " + pet_name)
```
Day 1 was all about learning how to use the print, len, and input functions. I also learned how to manipulate strings, and how to create variables in Python.
